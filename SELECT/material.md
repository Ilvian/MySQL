Got it! Here's an explanation of the SQL commands used in the queries you showed:

1. **`SELECT`**: This command retrieves data from a database table. You specify the columns you want to retrieve.

2. **`FROM`**: This specifies the table from which to retrieve the data.

3. **`WHERE`**: This is used to filter records based on specified conditions. Only rows that meet the condition will be included in the result set.

4. **`AND`**: This logical operator combines multiple conditions in a `WHERE` clause. All conditions combined with `AND` must be true for a row to be included.

5. **`OR`**: This logical operator allows for multiple conditions where at least one must be true for a row to be included.

6. **`!=`**: This operator means "not equal to". It filters records where the value of a column does not match the specified value.

7. **`IS NULL`**: This condition checks whether a column's value is `NULL` (i.e., it has no value).

8. **`DISTINCT`**: This keyword is used to return only unique (different) values in the result set, eliminating duplicates.

9. **`AS`**: This keyword renames a column or expression in the result set. For example, `author_id AS id` renames `author_id` to `id` in the result.

10. **`ORDER BY`**: This clause sorts the result set based on one or more columns. The default order is ascending.

11. **`LENGTH`**: This function returns the number of characters in a string. It is used to filter records based on the length of a text field.
